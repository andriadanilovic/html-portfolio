  <h1>Here's something about me</h1>
  <hr />
  <h3>My heritage</h3>
  <p>I come from Serbia, Belgrade - Third largest city on Balkan and the largest city on the northern part of Balkan peninsula.<br>
  My roots originate from all over Europe. Moteher side comes from Montenegro, fathers side originates from Russia.<br>
Being a second child, I've always had my ways with words and I could get things done (Totally not manipulative) but well...Life's life<br>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Academic background</h3>
<p>I've graduated on Metropolitan University of Belgrade in the field of graphic design. I'm contemplating which univesity<br>
and what field of studies should I start my masters on, but anyways in the mean while I took my time and started the<br>
Angela Yu Full Stack Web Developer course, and I have to admit, so far I'm loving it.</p>
