    <h1>Here's some of my favourite series</h1>
    <hr />
    <ol>
        <li>Game of Thrones</li>
        <p>Without the doubt my number one. I think I do not need explaining, even though season 8 was not the best.</p>
        <li>The last of us</li>
        <p>There's just something about post apocalypse and Pedro Pascal that does it for me.</p>
        <li>Prison break</li>
        <p>Who doesn't love some Michael Scoffield action. Season 1 is arguably GOAT series season compared to any other.</p>
        <li>The penguin</li>
        <p>If you're a fan of Gotham city and it's misteries, watch it and you'll definitely fall in love</p>
